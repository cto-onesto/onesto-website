              </h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Generally, Onesto collects your personal information directly from you. For example, Onesto may collect your personal information:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>where you use our websites, applications or platform; or</li>
                <li>when you register for an account with us, request information, products or services from us, or otherwise provide us with your details.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">
                There may be occasions when Onesto collects your personal information from other sources such as from:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4">
                <li>our other service providers that help us provide our products and services;</li>
