Your Shopping Account and your Savings Account will allow you to accept deposits from an external bank account. Once money has been deposited into your  Shopping Account you will be able to make purchases with our selected retailers in the Platform by using Shop. Please note that you cannot make giftcard purchases from your Savings Account, however you can transfer from your Savings Account to your Shopping Account.

After completing your purchases, your cashback saving will be transferred into your Savings Account. You can transfer funds from your Shopping Account and your Savings Account, free of charge.

You can make withdrawals from your Shopping Account and your Savings Account. Please note that transaction times will vary. You can withdraw funds to an Australian bank account of your choice.

When making any bank transfers through when using the Platform, it’s your responsibility to ensure that all bank account information you have provided is correct. If you enter an incorrect BSB, account number or PAYID your payment may be paid to an unintended recipient and may not be recovered. We do not check that the details provided by you are correct or that the account name matches the account number. It is also your responsibility to ensure that your PAYID is correctly copied to your external bank if you wish to transfer funds into your Onesto Shopping Account or your Savings Account. If you enter an incorrect PAYID to your external bank when making a transfer your payment may be paid to an unintended recipient and may not be recovered.

Shop

The Platform allows you to make purchases at any of the approved retailers. Using funds from your Shopping Account, you can purchase a variable or fixed value giftcard for your desired approved retailer. Please note, you are not able to make purchases from funds in your Savings Account.

Giftcard means a stored value or prepaid card which:

1. 1.  can be used to purchase services or merchandise from suppliers;
1. 2.  may not be redeemable for cash;
1. 3.  prominently displays either the expiration date or the number of months following purchase that such card or mechanism expires.

For the avoidance of doubt, gift card means closed loop pre-paid cards.

Any terms and conditions pertaining to your purchase of a giftcard with a selected retailer will be displayed via the Platform before you confirm your purchase. Please note that any terms and conditions between you and the selected retailer are independent of us. If you have any issues with goods or services purchased with selected retailers using a giftcard purchased on the Platform, you should follow this up directly with the selected retailer.

Please note that the list of retailers is subject to change, and we make no warranties about the availability of any selected retailers on the Platform.

When selecting to purchase a giftcard with a selected retailer, if you wish to use funds in your Shopping Account for a one-off purchase, you can select the amount for that purchase at the time of payment and make the transaction using your variable value giftcard. If you are left with a residual balance on your Digital Giftcard, you can move this residual balance to the Gift Card Section in Pocket, where it will then be stored as a fixed card, for you to use another time.

Please note that we make no representations that it will be able to show residual balances of your Digital Giftcards. The availability of Digital Giftcards balances will depend on the specific approved retailer.

Loyalty

If you have a loyalty card for any of our approved retailers, you can store these in the Platform under the Pocket section for Loyalty Cards. You will be able to use your loyalty cards at selected retailers at the time of purchase, when using the Platform.

Awards

If your Member Group provides you with a monetary award via Awards, you will be able to make purchases via the Platform with any of the retailers for the amount provided. Any savings accrued will be placed into your Savings Account.

**3\. Consumer Rights**  
The delivery and the quality of the goods and/or services purchased by you with your Digital Giftcards is the responsibility of the approved retailer, where you make your purchase/s.

You acknowledge that we do not have any control over, and are not responsible or liable for, the products or services purchased from approved retailers on the Onesto platform using Digital Giftcards. We cannot ensure that an approved retailer will complete your transaction.

As a consumer, you have certain rights under consumer protection legislation (“Consumer Rights”). These rights include:

1. 1.  Statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law that goods will be of acceptable quality, match their description and be fit for any purpose made known to the consumer, and that services supplied will be provided with due care and skill and be reasonably fit for any specified purpose. When a statutory guarantee is breached, consumers are entitled to a range of remedies, including, in some cases, damages for reasonably foreseeable losses; and
1. 2.  Non-excludable implied warranties that financial services will be provided with due care and skill and that the services and any materials supplied in connection with them will be fit for any specified purpose.

Nothing in these Terms of Service is intended to exclude, restrict or modify any of your Consumer Rights, including by limiting our liability or imposing liability on you in a manner which would be considered unfair under the relevant consumer protection laws. Subject to your Consumer Rights, we do not give any implied warranties or guarantees.
