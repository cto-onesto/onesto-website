            <div>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">2. Authority to Make Deductions</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                To access Onesto’s Earned Wage Access Service, you must agree and provide authorisation to allow your Employer to make deductions from your wages in accordance with the requirements of the Fair Work Act 2009 (Cth) (“Fair Work Act”). This authorisation is required to enable Onesto to provide its Earned Wage Access Service to you, and to enable your Employer to deduct from your Receivable Wages an amount to repay to us the benefit you receive from us via the Onesto Platform, being an advance on your Receivable Wages, plus the payment to us of the Payout Fee. If you do not want to use the Earned Wage Access Service, you can opt out of it in the on-boarding process, or by contacting Support.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                It is your choice as to whether you authorise your Employer to make a deduction from your Receivable Wages and pay that amount to Onesto, however, if you do not provide such authorisation, Onesto cannot provide its services, including the Earned Wage Access Service, to you.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In particular, section 324 of the Fair Work Act only permits your Employer to make deductions from your Receivable Wages where you provide written authorisation for your Employer to do so, and where the deduction authorised by you is principally for your benefit. When you sign up to Onesto, and in addition to other information you provide to us or we seek to obtain from you or from your Employer about you, you will:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 pl-4">
                <li>check a box to confirm that you have authorised your Employer, in writing, to make deductions on your behalf, and for your Employer to pay such deductions to Onesto, referable to the Earned Wage Access amount you will receive from Onesto and the applicable Payout Fee; and</li>
                <li>acknowledge and agree that you have given such authorisation of your own accord, for your own benefit and in the absence of any influence or pressure to do so by your Employer.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The amount you authorise your employer to deduct will be expressly shown to you when you use Onesto and request the wages on demand service. On each occasion you request Earned Wage Access, you will receive an advance payment (the amount of which is determined by you and may vary at your election) on your Receivable Wages. The Earned Wage Access amount will be displayed on the Onesto Platform, which will separately display the Deduction Amount which is owed in relation to the Earned Wage Access amount.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Each request for a Wage Access is a one-off (as opposed to recurring) payment request. In respect of each amount you request using the Earned Wage Access service on the Onesto Platform, you must separately authorise your Employer to deduct the Deduction Amount from your Receivable Wages and to pay that amount to Onesto.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Where you provide such authorisation, your Employer (or Payroll Processor, if applicable) will deduct the Deduction Amount from the Receivable Wages owing to you on the next Pay Date and pay the Deduction Amount to Onesto.
              </p>
              <p>
                You may withdraw your authorisation for your Employer to make a deduction from your Receivable Wages and to pay that deduction to Onesto at any time, provided that where an Earned Wage Access amount has already been paid to you before the relevant Pay Date, you acknowledge and agree that your earlier authorisation will continue to apply until Onesto has received from your Employer (or Payroll Processor, if applicable), or from you in the event that your Employer is unable to pay (refer to clause 10 below), the Deduction Amount owed in respect of the Advanced Wages.
              </p>

            <div>
              <h2 className="text-2xl font-semibold text-gray-900 mb-4">3. Your Onesto Virtual Accounts</h2>
              <p className="mb-4">
                After agreeing to these Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you will have two (2) virtual accounts set up and accessible via the Onesto application – your “Shopping Account” and your “Savings Account” (collectively “Virtual Accounts”). Each of these Virtual Accounts will have their own Pay ID, and or/BSB and account number. These Virtual Accounts are provided by Onesto’s third-party payment provider, Zepto Payments Pty Ltd (“Zepto”).
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You acknowledge that you must accept the Zepto’s terms and conditions as contained in Zepto’s website, and updated and amended from time to time, before using their payment services, and that Zepto’s terms and conditions are hereby incorporated into these Terms of Use. The links to Zepto’s website and relevant web pages are listed as follows for your reference:

              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Your Virtual Accounts are for your personal use only. You must not permit another person to access your Onesto account or your Virtual Accounts.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Your Shopping Account and your Savings Account will allow you to accept deposits from an external bank account, or your Earned Wage payments. Once money has been deposited into your Shopping Account you will be able to make purchases with our selected retailers in the Onesto Application by using Onesto Shop. Please note that you cannot make giftcard purchases from your Savings Account, however you can transfer from your Savings Account to your Shopping Account. Please note that by accepting these Terms of Service, you warrant that any transfers made to your Virtual Accounts are made only for the purpose of transacting within the Onesto Platform.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                After completing your purchases, your cashback saving will be transferred into your Savings Account. You can transfer funds from your Shopping Account and your Savings Account, free of charge.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You can make withdrawals from your Shopping Account and your Savings Account. Please note that transaction times will vary. You can withdraw funds to an Australian bank account of your choice.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                When making any bank transfers through when using Onesto, it’s your responsibility to ensure that all bank account information you have provided is correct. If you enter an incorrect BSB, account number or PAYID your payment may be paid to an unintended recipient and may not be recovered. Onesto does not check that the details provided by you are correct or that the account name matches the account number. It is also your responsibility to ensure that your PAYID is correctly copied to your external bank if you wish to transfer funds into your Onesto Shopping Account or your Savings Account. If you enter an incorrect PAYID to your external bank when making a transfer your payment may be paid to an unintended recipient and may not be recovered.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 my-4">Shop</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Onesto Platform allows you to make purchases at any of the approved retailers on the Onesto Platform. Using funds from your Shopping Account, you can purchase a variable or fixed value giftcard for your desired approved retailer. Please note, you are not able to make purchases from funds in your Savings Account.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Giftcard means a stored value or prepaid card which:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 pl-4">
                <li>can be used to purchase services or merchandise from suppliers;</li>
                <li>may not be redeemable for cash;</li>
                <li>prominently displays either the expiration date or the number of months following purchase that such card or mechanism expires.</li>
              </ul>
              <p className="mb-4">
                For the avoidance of doubt, gift card means closed loop pre-paid cards.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Any terms and conditions pertaining to your purchase of a giftcard with a selected retailer will be displayed via the Onesto Platform before you confirm your purchase. Please note that any terms and conditions between you and the selected retailer are independent of Onesto. If you have any issues with goods or services purchased with selected retailers using a giftcard purchased on the Onesto Platform, you should follow this up directly with the selected retailer.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Please note that the list of retailers available on the Onesto Platform is subject to change, and Onesto makes no warranties about the availability of any selected retailers on the Onesto Platform.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                When selecting to purchase a giftcard with a selected retailer, if you wish to use funds in your Shopping Account for a one-off purchase, you can select the amount for that purchase at the time of payment and make the transaction using your variable value giftcard. If you are left with a residual balance on your Digital Giftcard, you can move this residual balance to the Gift Card Section in Pocket, where it will then be stored as a fixed card, for you to use another time.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Please note that Onesto makes no representations that it will be able to show residual balances of your Digital Giftcards. The availability of Digital Giftcards balances will depend on the specific approved retailer.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 my-4">Loyalty</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                If you have a loyalty card for any of our approved retailers, you can store these in the Onesto Platform under the Pocket section for Loyalty Cards. You will be able to use your loyalty cards at selected retailers at the time of purchase, when using the Onesto Platform.
              </p>
              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 my-4">Awards</h3>
              <p>
                If your Employer provides you with a monetary award via Onesto’s Awards, you will be able to make purchases via the Onesto Platform with any of the retailers for the amount provided. Any savings accrued will be placed into your Savings Account.

              <p className="mb-4">
                The delivery and the quality of the goods and/or services purchased by you with your Digital Giftcards is the responsibility of the approved retailer, where you make your purchase/s.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You acknowledge that we do not have any control over, and are not responsible or liable for, the products or services purchased from approved retailers on the Onesto platform using Digital Giftcards. We cannot ensure that an approved retailer will complete your transaction.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                As a consumer, you have certain rights under consumer protection legislation (“Consumer Rights”). These rights include:
              </p>
              <ul className="list-disc list-inside space-y-2 mb-4 pl-4">
                <li>Statutory guarantees under the Australian Consumer Law that goods will be of acceptable quality, match their description and be fit for any purpose made known to the consumer, and that services supplied will be provided with due care and skill and be reasonably fit for any specified purpose. When a statutory guarantee is breached, consumers are entitled to a range of remedies, including, in some cases, damages for reasonably foreseeable losses; and</li>
                <li>Non-excludable implied warranties that financial services will be provided with due care and skill and that the services and any materials supplied in connection with them will be fit for any specified purpose.</li>

              <p>
                Nothing in these Terms of Service is intended to exclude, restrict or modify any of your Consumer Rights, including by limiting our liability or imposing liability on you in a manner which would be considered unfair under the relevant consumer protection laws. Subject to your Consumer Rights, we do not give any implied warranties or guarantees. Except as required by law, we do not guarantee continuous, uninterrupted or secure access to our Digital Giftcards on our platform, and we make no representations or warranties regarding the amount of time needed to complete the processing of orders or payment transactions.

              <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold text-gray-900 my-4">Payout Fee</h3>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Earned Wage Access Service in the Onesto Platform allows you to receive payments of between $100-$500 of your wages prior to your ordinary pay date. If you request an Earned Wage Access payment, you may be charged a flat fee of $5.00 AUD each time you use the service (the “Payout Fee”). This fee is shown to you at the time you request your Earned Wage Access Service from Onesto and you will provide written authorisation regarding your Employer deducting this amount. The Payout Fee will be payable at the time of payment of your Earned Wage Access payment.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Payout Fee is the charge for participating in Onesto’s Earned Wage Access Service.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                The Payout Fee is not dependent on the amount that you request from Onesto. You incur the Payout Fee for each transaction of Earned Wage Access payment, irrespective of the amount you receive, if you request payment to an external bank account. We want you to get the most from our service, and so we recommend that you keep this is in mind. For example, two (2) advances of $100, for example, will cost twice as much as one (1) advance of $200.

              <p>
                Except for the Processing Fee as outlined in the preceding paragraph, there are no additional fees for using the Onesto Platform.

                If any of the above representations are not true and correct at the time an Earned Wage Access payment request is made by you, Onesto reserves the right to determine that you have breached these Terms of Service, and to take any of the actions detailed under clause 10 below in relation to your use or continued use of the Onesto Platform.
              </p>

                Onesto reserves the right at any time to provide written documentary evidence to your Employer regarding your use of the Onesto Platform, including but not limited to confirmation that you have signed up to Onesto, and your written authorisation to make deductions from your salary or wages. We may also notify your Employer in the event you elect to stop using Onesto’s Platform. You agree to Onesto communicating with your Employer and disclosing certain information to your Employer as a condition of you using, and in order to facilitate the ongoing provision to you of, Onesto’s services.

              <p className="mb-4">
                At the time an Earned Wage Access payment is paid to you, your Employer and, if applicable, Payroll Provider will be notified, either by you or by Onesto acting on your behalf, that you have received an Earned Wage Access payment. You consent to Onesto notifying your Payroll Processor or Employer and, if applicable, Payroll Provider on each separate occasion that you request, and Onesto agrees to provide to you, an Earned Wage Access payment (“Earned Wage Access Notification”).
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You acknowledge and agree that an Earned Wage Access Notification (whether it is given by you or Onesto acting on your behalf) will constitute a written acknowledgement and confirmation by you that you have received from Onesto a portion of your Receivable Wages in advance and that you authorise your Employer and, if applicable, Payroll Processor, to withhold the Deduction Amount from your Receivable Wages on the next Pay Date.

                If you have received an Earned Wage Access payment from Onesto, you must not notify your Employer and, if applicable, Payroll Processor that you have not received it with a view to avoiding repayment of the Deduction Amount to Onesto. Any such action will constitute a breach of these Terms of Service and may result in Onesto withdrawing the services it provides to you. Onesto reserves the right to take such action as is required to recover from you any Earned Wage Access amount paid to you which is not repaid to Onesto in accordance with these Terms of Service and any other action that may be available to it in the circumstances.

              <p className="mb-4">
                In order to provide its Earned Wage Access Services to you, Onesto uses several methods to determine your current earnings, such as the earnings history and time and attendance data you provide to Onesto, together with any information Onesto requests from your Employer. In rare instances, Onesto may incorrectly calculate or record your earnings information, which may result in an Earned Wage Access payment being paid to you in excess of your Receivable Wages.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You acknowledge and agree that a Deduction Amount owing in respect of an Earned Wage Access payment is to be repaid on the Pay Date immediately following the Earned Wage Access payment to you. In the event that the Earned Wage Access amount exceeds your Receivable Wages for that Pay Period, such that there is a balance owing to Onesto in respect of the Deduction Amount, you will authorise your Employer, in writing, to make a deduction (or deductions) on the following Pay Date (or subsequent Pay Dates) in order to repay the Deduction Amount in full.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In the event that you are no longer employed by your Employer, or for any other reason you do not receive a further payment of salary or wages from your Employer, Onesto will contact you directly to make arrangements for you to repay the balance owing to Onesto.
              </p>
              <p className="mb-4">
                In either scenario, we will communicate with you regarding the reason for the overpayment, the amount of the overpayment and the way in which Onesto proposes that repayments will be made. In the event that this would create any financial issue for you, please reach out to Onesto at www.Onesto.co where our support staff will work with you on this issue.
